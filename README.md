## Kitten LLC Recruitment Candidate Filter
Kitten LLC, a company specializing in the development of digital content like animations and online games showcasing adorable kitten characters, as well as retailing merchandise including clothing and accessories, is experiencing a surge in sales. The heightened demand necessitates an expansion of the workforce. However, being an emerging company, Kitten LLC is currently facing a substantial influx of job applicants, posing a challenge in discerning the most suitable candidates for the available positions. The hiring team identifies the following business challenges:


- Challenges arise when discerning which candidates align more closely with the required qualifications compared to others, making the selection process complex and time-consuming
- Finding candidates to fill roles in the following areas: Marketing, Engineering, Graphical Design/UX, IT
- To address these challenges, Kitten LLC requires a Visual Basic Designer Form application that filters candidates depending on their qualifications:
- Filter out minimum GPA, Class Rank
- Have a specific graduation year and multiple majors
- View potential candidatesâ€™ information (GPA, class rank, graduation year, majors, etc.)
- Display all of the candidates and the potential candidates in separate listboxes
- A text file to view all of the student applications
